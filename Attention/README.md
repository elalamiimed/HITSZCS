## Please keep in mind
## Beta version of HITSZCS-WAIGUO 1.0

This course is mainly made for computer science and technology students. However there is a possibility that I add materials related to other majors in the future.
## Update 
Some of the content can be valuable for first year students for other majors such as the elementary chinese 1 and the pre-calculus, the linear algebra section too!

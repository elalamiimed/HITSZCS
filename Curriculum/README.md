- **Pre-Calculus** - Preparatory mathematics for calculus (20% Homework + 30% Midterm + 50% Final). Study resources and notes available through course materials.

- **Linear Algebra** - Matrix operations, vector spaces, and linear transformations. Includes 2024 and 2025 versions with in-class materials, midterm, and homework solutions.

- **College Physics IA** (Difficulty: Very High) - Covers mechanics (Chapters 1-10, midterm) and electromagnetism (Chapters 11-16, final exam). Grading: 20% Assignments/Quizzes + 30% Midterm + 50% Final. Attendance recorded via QR code; high failure rate requires careful attention.

- **Physics Lab IA** - Experimental physics laboratory work for hands-on learning.

- **Electric Circuits** - Basic circuit theory and analysis (40% Assignments + 60% Final Exam). Includes textbook solutions and course materials.

**Language Course:**

- **Elementary Chinese I** - Chinese language course for international students. Emphasis on writing and pronunciation. Multiple versions available (2024-2025) with structured lessons from different instructors.

### 🎓 Sophomore Year
Intermediate-level courses for second-year students building on freshman foundations.

**Physics & Engineering:**

- **College Physics IB** (Difficulty: Moderate, compared to IA) - Advanced physics topics including:
  - Waves (sound and electromagnetic waves)
  - Thermodynamics (heat transfer, latent heat, entropy)
  - Optics (refraction, diffraction, interference, single/double slit experiments)
  - Quantum Mechanics (Schrödinger equation, wave functions, probability)
  Organized with topic slides, assignments, and practice materials.

- **Physics Lab IB** - Advanced experimental physics complementing Physics IB theory.

- **Fundamentals of Electronic Technology** - Covers both analog and digital circuits with separate folders for each. Includes homework assignments and comprehensive slide presentations.

**Computer Science & Programming:**

  - Stacks, queues, linked lists
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection)
  - Advanced algorithms (KMP, linked list manipulation)

- **Computer Networks** - Networking fundamentals and protocols. Includes resources for certifications like TryHackMe and Cisco Networking Academy for extended learning.

**Mathematics:**

- **Probability and Statistics** - Statistical methods and probability theory. Essential PDFs and lookup tables available in course materials.

**Language Course:**

- **Intermediate Chinese I** - Continuation of Chinese language studies for international students.

**Other:**

- **Life And Health Science** - Health and biological sciences course materials.

### 🌍 Elective Courses
Optional courses for broader knowledge:

## 📚 Additional Resources

This repository also contains:
- **Computer Science at HITSZ (Must Know).pdf** - Essential guide covering computer science curriculum requirements and guidance

## ⚠️ Important Notice
It is highly important to pay attention to the information in the files, as course materials may contain critical deadlines, requirements, and academic guidelines. Difficulty levels vary significantly between courses—physics courses (especially IA) have high failure rates. Attendance requirements, quiz submissions, and exam preparation materials are crucial for success.

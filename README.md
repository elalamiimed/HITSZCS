## PREFACE
As students, we dive into a wide range of courses throughout our university years. With each subject, we gather more than just knowledge—we accumulate resources, tips, and insights along the way.

Some of this comes from searching for materials online, like tracking down e-books or textbooks, often through trial and error. At times, it’s easy to find what we need, but other times it feels like a scavenger hunt, piecing things together from various corners of the web. Then there are the shared documents—past exams, notes, and advice—handed down from one generation of students to the next, circulating in tight-knit groups or through personal connections. And finally, there are the lessons we only realize after the fact, the strategies and shortcuts we wish we’d known earlier.

Personally, I’ve spent countless hours searching for the right materials, only to find some of the most crucial ones by luck. It’s frustrating to think that important information is out there, but not easily accessible. After each course, I find myself reflecting on how I could’ve approached things differently, yet these insights often remain unshared.

It seems unnecessary that every new group of students should struggle with the same challenges, repeating the same efforts year after year.

That’s why I started this project: to gather and centralize the resources and experiences of students who’ve already been through these courses. By sharing this knowledge openly, I hope to make it easier for others to succeed and to build a stronger foundation for future students.

My goal is to reduce the unnecessary detours, so that those who come after us can move forward more confidently.

## VISION
- Uphold and respect intellectual property rights, ensuring that all contributions align with ethical standards.
- Strive to reduce the inequality brought about by information asymmetry, making knowledge more accessible to all.
- Our goal is to support students by offering helpful resources and guidance, while standing firmly against any form of plagiarism.
- This repository is and will remain a public, free, and open-source platform dedicated to the betterment of students, ensuring accessibility for everyone, always.

## WHY GITHUB AND NOT OTHER PLATFORMS
- GitHub repositories are easy to use and more organized.
- Git is very simple and with a couple of steps you can make a repository.
- Most of computer science groups are separated so the information can not be shared in between.
- Everyone can access to it and contribute to this project.
